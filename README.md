This is an AutoHotkey script that provides your the ability to AFK a Blazefarm.

How does it work, whenever a blaze spawns in it will hit it by using your mouse button input.

Is this script a Virus, NO its not it its an Ahk script that presses buttons for you simular to a Autoclicker but instead of spamming the button it will only react when a certain color apears in the middle of your screen.
color to react (Yello: **0xFEFE40** 0x stands for an **#** for further questions you can ask me trough discord @Adalie_
